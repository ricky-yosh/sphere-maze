# Sphere Maze

## What is it?
Guide a ball through 3D maze levels using physics to reach the goal while collecting items and avoiding hazards/enemies.

## Core Loop
Roll around → Navigate obstacles → Collect gems → Reach exit → Next level

## Key Mechanics
- Physics-based ball movement (rolling, bouncing)
- Environmental puzzles (switches, moving platforms, ramps)
- Collectibles scattered throughout levels
- Enemy spheres trying to push player off level

## The Feel
Satisfying physics with good momentum - like playing with a marble but with purpose. Should feel smooth and predictable, not floaty or slippery.

## Must Have
- [ ] Responsive ball physics and movement
- [ ] Basic level with ramps and platforms
- [ ] Collectible gems
- [ ] Goal/exit system
- [ ] Simple UI (gems collected, level complete)
- [ ] Enemy spheres tracking player

## Nice to Have
- [ ] Moving platforms and obstacles
- [ ] Multiple levels
- [ ] Timer/score system
- [ ] Particle effects for collection
- [ ] Sound effects for rolling/bouncing

## Not Doing
Complex storyline, character progression, or multiple ball types
